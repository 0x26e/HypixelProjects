Many of these projects require API key usage!

This is done via having a file named `API_KEY.json` in the same directory.

The contents of this file should follow the format:

```python
{
    "API_KEY": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" # Insert your API key here
}
```

The lists of projects that require this are:
`hyp_parse_everything.py`
